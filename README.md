# Colour Contrast Checker

* [Demo](https://debccheng.github.io/contrast-checker/)
* Written with React hooks
* Checks the contrast ratio between two colours based on user input
* Breakpoint ratios are set at 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text (>14pt) as per WCAG AAA requirements
* Contrast ratio calculation is based on [formulas provided by W3A](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G17#G17-procedure)
* Idea inspired by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
